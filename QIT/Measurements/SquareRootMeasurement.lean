# Square-root measurement

The "pretty good" or square-root measurement (also called the PGM, for
pretty-good measurement) on a finite family of positive semidefinite
operators. For a PSD family `(Sᵢ)`, the total `S = Σᵢ Sᵢ` is positive
semidefinite; each effect is `Λᵢ = S^{-1/2} Sᵢ S^{-1/2}`, where the inverse
square root acts on the support of `S` and annihilates its kernel. The effects
form a sub-POVM — their sum is the support projector of `S`, hence at most `1`
— and are completed to a POVM on `Option ι` by adding a failure outcome
`none` carrying `1 - Σᵢ Λᵢ`. This measurement is the packing-lemma decoder of
classical capacity theory [Wilde2011Qst, qit-notes.tex:29363-29415].
