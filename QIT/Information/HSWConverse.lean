# HSW converse: regularized Holevo upper-bounds classical capacity

The converse half of the HSW theorem: every operationally achievable
classical communication rate for a quantum channel `N` is bounded above by the
regularized Holevo information `χ_reg(N)`. The chain reduces a reliable `n`-use
classical code to a randomness-distribution relaxation, then chains three
estimates: Alicki–Fannes–Winter (AFW) continuity of (conditional) entropy, the
quantum data-processing inequality for mutual information, and the
classical-quantum Holevo supremum bound.

The three sub-estimates and the final converse inequality are recorded here as
proof-pending statements (the AFW continuity bound and strong subadditivity /
mutual-information data-processing inequality are not yet formalized in the
library). Each is stated in the repository's conventions so that a proof
materializes the converse directly.

/-- The classical-register marginal of a cq state has Shannon entropy:
`S(ω_X) = -Σ_x xlog₂ p_x` (the base-2 Shannon entropy of the ensemble's
distribution). Routes the diagonal-state entropy bridge through
`Ensemble.partialTraceB_cqState`, which identifies the marginal with `diag(p)`.
This is the `H(p)` term in the cq-Holevo identity `I(X;B)_ω = χ`. -/

/-- Alicki–Fannes–Winter continuity of the conditional von-Neumann entropy:
for states `ρ, σ` on `A ⊗ B` with trace distance `½‖ρ − σ‖₁ ≤ ε`, the conditional
entropies differ by at most `ε log(d − 1) + h(ε)` where `d = dim B`.

/-- Quantum data-processing inequality for the von-Neumann mutual information:
applying a CPTP map to one subsystem cannot increase mutual information,
`I(A ; N(B))_ρ ≤ I(A ; B)_ρ`. Recorded proof-pending: DPI for the von-Neumann
`mutualInformation` is not formalized (it follows from strong subadditivity,
itself unproved here). -/

/-- Classical-quantum Holevo supremum bound: the mutual information of any cq
state `Σ_x p(x) |x⟩⟨x| ⊗ σ_x` is at most the Holevo information
`χ = S(Σ p σ_x) − Σ p S(σ_x)`, and for the channel-output cq state at most
`χ(N^{⊗ n})`. Recorded proof-pending: no cq Holevo / mutual-information bridge
is proved. -/

/-- HSW converse: every operationally achievable classical communication rate
for `N` is bounded above by the regularized Holevo information `χ_reg(N)`, i.e.
`regularizedHolevoInformation` is a classical-rate upper bound (and hence
`classicalCapacity ≤ regularizedHolevoInformation`). It assembles the
randomness-distribution reduction with the AFW, data-processing, and cq-Holevo
estimates above. Recorded proof-pending. -/
