# Universal recovery map (Fawzi-Renner)

The Fawzi-Renner theorem and its recovery channel are reserved for the
information-recovery layer.

This module provides the import surface for recovery-map definitions. The
linear map construction (`embedRecoveryMap`) and the full inequality proof
will be added here once their mathematical prerequisites are available.
